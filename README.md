# Second website

Hello, and thanks for visiting! I enjoy talking, and I hope you enjoy listening
:)

## Building

1. Install jekyll with `gem install jekyll`
	- Instructions for gem are available [here][ruby]
2. Run `jekyll build`. All set!

## Contributing

Since this is a personal site, I will be more selective than usual
with pull requests. I will take requests for stories/topics via
the [issue](https://github.com/jyn514/second-website) page.
