I plan to update this site with news of my exploits.

## FAQs
These questions are not frequently asked. I normally get questions like
- How was your break?
- Hey, how do you do this computing assignment? I'm confused.

These are the questions I wish people would ask.

> How can I learn more about computers?

Lots of ways! I have a list of [links](https://github.com/jyn514/resources) just for this.
The basic ways:

- [Practice](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
- [Google](https://www.google.com/)!
- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)

More FAQs about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq).

> How can I learn about the history of computing?

I recommend starting [here](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/).
Eric Raymond is somewhat prominent for his great work in the open source community.

> That's a nice profile picture! Where was it taken?

[The University of Tampa](https://www.ut.edu/)

> How can I start my own website?

I recommend using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). I have a 
[tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-12-28-Setting-up-Jekyll.md %})
for how to use Jekyll, the templating manager on the Pages backend.
